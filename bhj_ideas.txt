Bullet Hell Jam 2022

Idea:
- Mix adventure game w/ bullethell
- Castlevania-like feeling (get powerups, maybe level up, etc)
- Fight monsters in rooms and beat puzzles, all in bullet hell style
- Draw sigils to cast spells
	- Maybe some spells could create barriers
	- Others could slow time or make you disappear temporarily, etc
- HP/MP, maybe graze to trigger MP recovery?
- The main character is a flying fairy
- Controls: Mouse/Keyboard or Analog Stick (see if mouse w/ limited speed feels good)
- Maybe random encounters in rooms?

THEME: Confined

- A captured fairy which is trying to escape from a castle
- Start inside a chest, fight your way out?
- Get rid of your shackles, maybe each powerup makes you free from one.
- Unlock different parts of the castle until you get out


- As an adventure game, how are you supposed to do things?
- Possible Actions:
  - Look
  - Interact
  - Pick Up
- You can't do any actions if there is hostility (enemies, traps, anything happening that forces you to defend yourself
- Inspecting things may lead to enemy encounters

- How to defeat enemies? Should you be able to attack or just evade?
  - Just Evade: slow
  - You can fight back: better, but more difficult to balance.

- Systems in place to develop:
   - Text system (portraits? etc)
   - Controls (mouse/keyboard/gamepad)
   - Allow interaction with objects
