What's missing?
- SFX for light flickering at the beginning. DONE
- SFX for interacting with the keyhole. DONE
- Zoom in should pan the camera towards the keyhole. DONE
- SFX for getting hit during a bullet hell stage. DONE
- Music after getting back to the chest scene, after bullet hell.
- Interactives when the room is still dimly lit that tell you that's it's too dark to see.
- Death SFX

Bugfixes
- Radial bullet speed is not being resetted. Maybe bullet speed should be a param?. DONE

What would be cool?
- Shower bullets should fade in instead of instantly appearing? DONE
- A fanfare/fireworks effect when you finish a bullet hell stage.
- A visual effect when retrying a stage.

Story: Next Steps
- Allow crushing rocks for an optional bullet hell sequence. DONE
- Draw a cabinet that you can interact with to get the "Pick Up" action and enable inventory. (maybe ditch this)
- Allow using inventory items (that are usable) (maybe ditch this)
- The cabinet will be guarded by another magic sigil.
- Inside the cabinet there should be two items:
   + A cord so you can replace the one on the faulty plug object
   + A magic sphere that allows you to use magic (graze + slowdown)
- By trying to replacing the cord, you'll be sent to another bullet hell (electric)
- There needs to be a trigger for when you have the magic orb but still hasn't used it,
so the player knows what's up.
- After getting through it, the screen will flash and the whole room will be visible.
